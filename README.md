# PomodoroTimer
Pomodoro Timer is a timer that allows you to choose a certain work time and break time, these will run indefinetly until you turn them off. 
This way you can remember to take breaks regularly. 
The preset work and break times are 25 and 5 minutes (the Pomodoro technique) but can be changed to your tastes.

## Installation
Import this project to Android Studio to run it on your phone.

## Options
You can choose your own work time and break time (from 1 to 100 minutes). Right now you can only choose minutes, not seconds.
Once the time runs out for the work time or the break time an alarm and vibration notifies you.
Both the alarm and vibration can be turned on and off.
In the future you'll be able to choose your own alarm sound.
